          %h4.timeline-title Afterparty
          %p
            Head to a local bar or restaurant, get some drinks and appetizers,
            and celebrate all the awesome new things you've learned! This is a
            great chance to ask your TAs about what it's like to work as a
            developer. I'm sure they'd love to answer any questions you can
            throw at them.
